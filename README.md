Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software enginnering is the process of designing, building, testing and maintaining software. It's importance is to create efficient, scalable and reliable software solutions that meet the needs of it's users.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

1. Objected oriented programming - enabled developers to create reusable code components based on real-world objects
2. Clouds computing - increased accessibility to computing power and data storage
3. Modular programming - Promoted better oraganization and code

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

Planning - Defining the project goals 
Design - making a blueprint on how the software will look and work
Development - writing code of the software
Testing - To ensure that the software is working perfectly
Deployment - Putting the software live, where the users can start using it.
Maintenance - Checking on the software by fixing any problems that may have arised.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.



Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the art of crafting questions or statements to get the best responses from AI models.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
"Tell me about solar energy in Kenya"

"Could you analyze the impact of the introduction to solar energy in Kenyan local communities between 2010-2020, focusing mostly on job creation and changes of electricty costs in the rural areas in Kenya"
